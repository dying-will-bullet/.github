## What is "Dying Will Bullet"?

The "Dying Will Bullet" is a special bullet used in my favorite series "Kateky≈ç Hitman Reborn!"
to give the protagonist, Tsunayoshi Sawada, a temporary surge of determination and courage.
It allows him to face challenges with a fearless attitude and tap into his hidden potential.
"Dying Will bullet" is made from the Vongola tradition of burying prime bullets in the
shape-changing chameleon's body for three days. Chameleons and lizards are closely related.

## Why is it an organization?

Because I already have many repositories under my personal account,
so I decided to migrate Zig-related projects to this organization.
If there are any issues, you can directly mention @Hanaasagi.
